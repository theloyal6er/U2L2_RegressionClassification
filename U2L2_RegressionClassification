The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months.
- Classification: Understanding the time spent on a site through a categorical lens is most likely difficult to do given the amount of time spent is so varied between person to person. Creating a model that tracks average time spent through their actions on the website is most likely the best way to go about this model.

What color car someone is going to buy.
- Categorical: Because the inventory of car colors are most likely a set number of colors - i.e. red, blue, black, white, etc. - there are only so many choices a customer can make. Thus creating an algorithm that shows what a customer is most likely going to buy will best fit the model appropriately.

How many children a family will have.
- Categorical: Because the numerical categories of children in a family are not wide-ranging, it is more likely to see the number of children varying between 0-5 with outliers 6 and above. Calculating probability within these buckets will give better indicators of our model for how many children a fmamily will have.

If someone will sign up for a service.
- Categorical: We can have a {Yes, No} model that shows whether someone will sign up for a service. Then calculating the probability wtihin each bucket might give an indication as to whether someone will or will not sign up for the service.

The number of times someone will get sick in a year.
- Classification: The number of times someone will get sick will be varied so it is best to undergo a classification model that shows a varied number of times across people. Since we are looking for a number of people versus a categorical value, which understands whether someone will be sick or not.

The probability someone will get sick in the next month.
- Categorical: You can use a {Yes, No} model that shows the probability between Yes/No to see the likelihood whether someone gets sick or not. This shows intrinsically the probability whether someone will get sick or not.

Which medicine will work best for a given patient.
- Classification: Because the range of medicine is so wide-ranging, showing a classfication model displaying the medicine as to what works best is the main way to see which medicine will work best. A wide range of medicine will show the effectiveness accordingly.
